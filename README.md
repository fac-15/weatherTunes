- Create API keys folder (if API keys are required)
- Install jest with the following:  
    ```npm install --save-dev jest```


## APIs:


### :zap: Open Weather Map:


```
api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London
```
[London](api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London)

```
api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk
```
[London, UK](api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk)


### :musical_note: Youtube
- https://developers.google.com/youtube/
- Although we did manage it eventually we found this api less simple to understand how to use. This was partly because the call we are making to it is more complex but also because we found the documentaiton more obtuse.

## Proposed APIs:

###  :ring: Spotify
 - **found out this required oAuth authentication with curl or whatever, seemed like a faff, so went with YoutTube**
 - [Getting a track by Spotify ID](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-track/)
 - [Searching for a track](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/)


## User Stories & Goals

### :books: User Stories

- User views app
- User types in city
- User presses enter
- User is given predicted weather
- User can hear a song that is linked to the weather

### :trophy: Goals
- Get the weather of any city.
- Handle cases where the location isnâ€™t recognised.
- Print the weather back to the html.
- Manipulate the weather into usable text/phrase.
- Sent the weather phrase to music api.
- Song as a response from the music api to the html.
- Display/ play song.

### :left_right_arrow: Stretch Goals
- Ability to play/pause youtube video (music source)
- Autocomplete in the form field as you type
    - Would help to eliminate user error (i.e. misspelling of location) in text input
    - example from **Wes Bos** tutorials (using fetch API), as follows:
    - [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4gZMJKAeWs)
    - [Github](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead)


### :pencil2: Things learned / compromises etc
- We need better handling of errors, e.g.
    - same named cities (e.g. London U.K. and London, Canada)
    - misspelling of cities could be handled by an autocomplete (see above)
    - this is probably going to be difficult
- YouTube isn't the best way to get good music, but we couldn't use Spotify!
    - had some disappointing results. I want purple rain dammit! :purple_heart:
- Objects act weird (and return `undefined`) if their keys start with a number.
    - this was discovered when mapping icons supplied from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions) (a bit :shit:) to [Erik Flowers Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
    - used a string from API call, which began with a number, (e.g. `50d`) to select a key in an object, which would supply the icon class from [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
    - issue fixed by modifying strings such as `50d` to become `a50`, and `01` to become `a01`, which worked as predicted.
- once you have your head around the youtube api there's alot of specifying you can do regarding your search parameters.
